Java Image Compressor

📖 Story
This project was created for my kuya, who works at sea where stable internet is a luxury. Sending images quickly is a challenge because raw files are often too large, and online compression tools aren’t accessible offline.
This offline image compressor became a game-changer for him, allowing images to be compressed efficiently without needing an internet connection.
