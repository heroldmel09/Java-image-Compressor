Java Image Compressor
📖 Story

This project was created for my kuya who works at sea, where there is no stable internet connection. Sending images quickly is a challenge because raw files are too large, and online compression tools are not accessible offline.
This offline image compressor became a game-changer for him, allowing images to be compressed efficiently without needing an internet connection.

🚀 Features

Compress images offline (no internet required).

Supports common image formats (.jpg, .png, .gif).

Adjustable compression ratio (from 1.0 max to 0.1 min).

Simple and user-friendly Java Swing interface.

Saves disk space and improves image transfer speed.

🎯 Objectives

General Objective:
Develop an offline image compressor software program to assist users in managing and compressing their files anytime and anywhere.

Specific Objectives:

Evaluate cost savings and faster transmission with offline image compression.

Analyze benefits of offline compression for better user experience.

Provide recommendations for using offline image compression effectively.

📌 Significance

Helps users (especially those without internet access) manage image file sizes.

Saves storage space and reduces costs.

Makes image transmission faster, especially in low-bandwidth environments.

Useful for students, professionals, and anyone with limited storage.

⚡ Scope and Limitations

✅ Focuses only on offline image compression.

✅ Improves cost savings, transmission speed, and user experience.

❌ Does not address security risks.

❌ Does not consider copyright implications.
